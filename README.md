# Candidate Search Project 
<p>This is a machine learning project to search desired candidate for a job post by recruiters from a csv file containing candidate data</p>
<br>
<p>Search takes place with respect to data mentioned in a seperate csv file </p>
<br>
<p>comparison is done through tfidf vectorization which creates vectors and similarity scores between the vectors are determined through cosine similarity and thus most desirable candidates are displayed having the highest similarity scores</p>
